## Description
In our game there are 4 players trapped in a grid maze. Once all 4 players load in, 8 squares will appear with a player's colour and a countdown (2 squares per player). There are also many obstacle squares scattered throughout the map that players cannot pass through. The goal of the players is to work together to reach each of their colored squares before the timers run out. As the players reach more squares and score points, the gameâ€™s level progresses and more colored squares appear with shorter countdowns. In the game, players cannot move through or jump over other players, so they have to work together to both get to their goal and stay out of each other's way.
